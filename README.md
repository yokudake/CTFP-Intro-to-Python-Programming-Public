# Start Here!

Hello there! Welcome to the Github Repository for my set of assignments for my project ***Programming Confidence with Wavefunctions using Computational
Literacy***: an introduction to python programming for students of undergraduate quantum mechanics in chemistry. Here you will find the code and supplementary material needed to implement the assignments into your curriculum. These assignments are intended to introduce undergraduate students in chemistry with little to no programming background to Python 3 through a variety of exercises that correlate to their studies in introductory quantum mechanics. 

***Disclaimer*** 

The current version of these assignments are being used, so the public version will have most of its code removed. However, outputs that don't require students to input code will still be visible (while the code itself will be redacted). If you are interested in viewing the full version of the assignments, including marking schemes, tutorial videos, and reflective questions, please contact Kelly at kelly.yokuda@gmail.com.

## Project Overview

### Motivation & Design 

Using programming languages to create models and visualize data has become a crucial and transferable skill for modern chemistry students. To enable University of Toronto chemistry students to fully adopt programming literacy into their study routine, I have developed a series of assignments to introduce Python 3 literacy to sophomore students in CHM223. The aim of these assignments is to introduce students to a primary Python 3 skill set, necessary for simulating the solution to Schrödinger's equations using industry-standard data manipulation and visualization packages, Matplotlib and NumPy.

Each assignment comprises three parts - a tutorial and exercises section, a companion tutorial video for each assignment, and three reflective questions per assignment. Each assignment will be written in Python 3 and executed in Jupyter Notebook to facilitate computation and communication. Furthermore, the assignments will be hosted on the University of Toronto Jupyter Hub server, allowing students to complete their assignments on any internet-connected computer without downloading any software. The tutorial will cover only the syntax fundamentals necessary for completing the assignments and will assume that the student has no programming experience beyond familiarity with Microsoft Excel or similar software.

The multiple-choice reflective questions will require students to refer to their code from the exercises section to answer conceptual questions about the systems in quantum mechanics they are simulating or the mathematical operations they are performing. These questions aim to reinforce the connection between the computational exercises and lecture material.

### Assignment 1: Applying Python Syntax Basics to Assessing Components of Complex Numbers
The goal of the assignment is to teach students how to compare the square modulus of a complex number with the product of the complex number and its complex conjugate. The tutorial portion of the assignment uses a demonstration to show students how to break down lines of code into their syntax components. The exercises portion of the assignment uses a strategy of "I do, you do" to guide students through building a Python 3 script that will evaluate the product of a complex number with its complex conjugate. Students are expected to maintain the structure of the script as written to ensure consistency and ease of marking. Finally, students will use their written script to solve a conceptual problem from their textbook as a summative assessment for the assignment.

### Assignment 2: Applying Python Functions and Plotting Methods to Visualizing Particle in 1D Box Solutions
This assignment aims to teach students the Python 3 syntax needed to plot probability densities for the general solution to the particle in a box wavefunction and check if they are normalized. The tutorial introduces functions and if-else statements and demonstrates how they can be used to solve problems requiring equations for the energy of a particle in a one-dimensional box and the relationship between a photon’s wavelength and energy. The exercises portion challenges students to apply the principles of function syntax and if-else statements to build and visualize the probability densities of solutions to the particle in a box model using given energy states and normalization conditions.

### Assignment 3: Applying Python Functions and Plotting Methods to Visualizing Particle in 2D Box Solutions and Degeneracy
The purpose of this assignment is to teach students how to use Python 3 to plot probability densities for the general solution to the 2-dimensional particle in a box wavefunction and determine if they are normalized. Students will learn to use functions, Matplotlib and NumPy modules, and if-else statements to complete the assignment. The tutorial will teach students how to plot contour plots or surface plots in three dimensions and how to model separate components of the 2D wavefunction. Students will be challenged in the exercise portion to apply their knowledge to plot solutions using the appropriate normalization constants and create contour and 3D surface plots. They will also learn how to model degenerate states using their knowledge of contour plots for the total wavefunction.
